## Used by the onix-parrot app
The Onix Parrot GitHub bot leverages an open-source solution for establishing a connection between GitHub and Cloud Run. This integration is made possible through the organization's OAuth app, which is responsible for receiving events from GitHub and subsequently forwarding them as HTTP calls to the designated Cloud Run app. The specific URL utilized for this purpose is [https://onix-gh-app-bttauxvkta-wl.a.run.app/webhook](https://onix-gh-app-bttauxvkta-wl.a.run.app/webhook).

To facilitate local development and testing, developers can employ ngrok to gain insights into the events and payloads being transmitted. This entails configuring the app's webhook to the URL generated by ngrok, allowing for real-time observation of the data exchanged between GitHub and the local bot instance. By setting the app's webhook to the ngrok-generated URL, developers can effectively monitor and analyze the communication flow, aiding in the debugging and refinement of the integration process.
